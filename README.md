### An interactive online resume

lukeshafer.com is my personal website designed with the following goals:

- Practice designing and coding a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Give employers a deeper view into my experience than a resume would allow, if they chose to seek it out
- Demonstrate to employer and example of my coding skills
